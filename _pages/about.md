Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an undergraduate student at Seoul National University.

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of **machine learning**, **applied cryptography**, and **computational neuroscience**.

I am deeply interested in developing a secure cloud memory system inspired by the human hippocampusâ€”one that continuously collects, stores, and leverages all lifelong, egocentric data from humans. Through this endeavor, I hope to not only enhance human memory, but also, in time, replicate the very essence of human identity.

More specifically, my research interests include:

**Machine Learning**  
- Efficient and Scalable Semantic Search  
- Instruction-Conditioned Imitation Learning

**Applied Cryptography**  
- Homomorphic Encryption (HE)  
- Private Information Retrieval (PIR)

**Computational Neuroscience**  
- Principles of how the hippocampus stores and recalls memories
- Principles of learning in the biological brain

If you share these interests or would like to explore potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out!
