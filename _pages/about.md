Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Seoul National University with a deep passion for machine learning and deep learning.

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of **machine learning**, **applied cryptography**, and **computational neuroscience**.

I am deeply interested in developing a secure cloud memory system that functions like the human hippocampus, aiming to closely replicate each person.

Iâ€™m always happy to connect with others who share these interests, so please feel free to reach out!
