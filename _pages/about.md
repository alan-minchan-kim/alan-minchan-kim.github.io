Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Seoul National University with a deep passion for machine learning and deep learning.

My primary research interests include Multimodal AI, Generative Search, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, and Homomorphic Encryption.

My ultimate goal is to develop an egocentric database that captures the I/O data of individuals, aiming to closely replicate each person.

Iâ€™m always happy to connect with others who share these interests, so please feel free to reach out!
