Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alan.

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Seoul National University, interested in practical and impactful research.

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of **machine learning**, **applied cryptography**, and **computational neuroscience**.

I'm deeply interested in developing a secure cloud memory system inspired by the human hippocampusâ€”one that continuously collects, stores, and utilizes an individualâ€™s lifetime of egocentric data.

Through this work, I aim to create an AI replica that shares your memories and acts with your intent. To achieve this, the system must (i) securely store and share your memories, (ii) think, speak, and act like you, and (iii) synchronize with you seamlessly and actively.

More specifically, my research interests include:

1. **Machine Learning**  
(a) Secure RAG
(b) Secure Semantic Search  
(c) Secure Imitation Learning

2. **Applied Cryptography**  
(a) Homomorphic Encryption  
(b) Multi-Party Computation  
(c) Private Information Retrieval

3. **Computational Neuroscience**  
(a) Principles of How the Hippocampus Stores and Recalls Memories  
(b) Principles of How the Brain Learns and Generalizes Knowledge

If you share these interests or would like to explore potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out!
